#Conky Test Configuration

#Anyone in the world can take this config, it's not special to me at all
#This was my first config and I wrote it from scratch so there's probably more efficient ways to do some of it
#Override option was not working for me, it may work for you
#For some of this stuff to work you may need to install gcalcli and setup the config yourself on that, as well as replace some of the options.
#
#Enjoy!!!

#Todo list
#Add weather and weatherforcast
#Eventually get to some lua magic
#Can use xmms2 instead of audacious, more command line based stuff but we'll see ;)
#Add more email scripts and support
#Encrypted or secure frameworks for password arrangments, hardcoded passwords are not good even though they're not traveling unsecurely across the wire.
